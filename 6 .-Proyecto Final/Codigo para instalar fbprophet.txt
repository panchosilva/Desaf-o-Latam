I had faced same problem. I used "conda" rather than "pip" for installation with steps shown below and it worked magical for me.

step 1: conda install -c anaconda ephem

step 2:conda install -c conda-forge pystan

step 3: conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet

Now you can go ahead with : "from fbprophet import Prophet" in python environment.
